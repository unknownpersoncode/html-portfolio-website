<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Rizwan, a passionate web developer with expertise in both the PERN
  stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) and Python full-stack development.
  I thrive on building dynamic, responsive, and scalable applications that
  deliver seamless user experiences. Whether it's crafting front-end interfaces
  or working with back-end logic, I enjoy every step of the development process
  to create high-quality solutions.
