<h3>Dark</h3>
<p>
  When two children go missing in a small German town, its sinful past is
  exposed along with the double lives and fractured relationships that exist
  among four families as they search for the kids. The mystery-drama series
  introduces an intricate puzzle filled with twists that includes a web of
  curious characters, all of whom have a connection to the town's troubled
  history -- whether they know it or not. The story includes supernatural
  elements that tie back to the same town in 1986. "Dark" represents the first
  German original series produced for Netflix.

  "high-functioning sociopath" in modern-day London. Assisting him in his
  investigations: Afghanistan War vet John Watson, who's introduced to Holmes by
